The paper draws on age-specific fertility and mortality rates from the latest Revision of the United Nations World Population Prospects (2019, estimates and projections) to assess trends in the frequency and timing of child death using formal demographic methods. We discuss the variation in woman's exposure to offspring mortality according to the demographic regimes prevailing in different world regions.
