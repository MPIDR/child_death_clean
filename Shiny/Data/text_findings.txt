We project a global reduction in the overall frequency of child death over the life course for younger cohorts of women. We expect the largest improvements in regions of the Global South where offspring mortality continues to be a common life event. In spite of persisting regional inequalities, we show evidence of a global convergence towards a future where the death of a child will become ever more infrequent for women. We anticipate that global population aging will be accompanied by an aging of generational relationships where life events such as the death of a child will be experienced at older ages.
