We investigate the effect of changing mortality and fertility levels on the experience of offspring mortality for successive female cohorts. Even with the projected improvements in child mortality, women will continue to experience child death in the future.  The study emphasizes that, far from being restricted to a woman's reproductive age, child loss occurs throughout the life course.  Indeed, given the anticipated changes in global demography, `child death' will increasingly come to mean the death of an adult offspring for younger generations of women.
