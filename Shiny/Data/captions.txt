Cumulative number of child deaths (CD) experienced by a woman reaching age a. The slope of the curves is positive at all ages, even after the end of a woman's reproductive age, because offspring mortality continues to accumulate over the life course. Defined as:
Total number of children surviving for a woman reaching age a (CS). Values in the vertical axis represent the number of children 'currently alive'. Defined as:
Number of child deaths experienced at each age a b a woman reaching that age (i.e. conditional on female survival). This is the First Difference of Child Death - its cumulative sum over age yields the measure of Child Death.  Defined as:
Burden of child death: total number of child deaths experienced by all women in a region and birth cohort at each age a (in millions). We obtained it by multiplying the First Difference of Child Death by the absolute number of women expected to survive to each age, considering the original size of each female birth cohort and the mortality rates prevalent in their countries of origin. This measure removes the assumption of female survival by accounting for the size and age structure of the population. Defined as:
Number of children expected to outlive an average woman. Values in the vertical axis show the number of children alive at the time of a woman's death if she survives to the life expectancy in her cohort and country of birth. Defined as:
Children expected to outlive a woman as a fraction of her cohort's Total Fertility Rate. Higher values indicate that a larger fraction of a woman's offspring is expected to live longer than her. Defined as:
