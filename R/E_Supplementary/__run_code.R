# Fig S1 (CD) - global estimates ====

# Global patterns of child death and child survival 
# for women in three different birth cohorts.
# (A) Cumulative number of child deaths (CD) 
# experienced by a woman reaching age $a$.
# (B) Total number of children surviving (CS) 
# for a woman reaching age $a$. Values in the vertical 
# axis represent the total number of children `currently alive'.
# (C) Number of child deaths experienced at each age $a$ by a woman 
# reaching that age (i.e. conditional on female survival).
# This is the First Difference of Child Death ($\Delta CD$).
# (D) Burden of child death: total number of child deaths experienced by 
# all women in a given birth cohort at each age $a$ (in millions).
# The solid lines represent median values and the bands the variability 
# among countries for each cohort.

# FigS2 - Number of children expected to outlive their mothers ====

# Number of children expected to live longer than their mothers, asuming 
# that the mothers survive to mean age at death (life expectancy) in 
# their cohort and country of birth.

# Datasets_S1_S2 ====

# The resulting files are quite large in size and are not included in 
# the SI pdf file.

# This script generates complete tables of child death and child survival estimates
# for supplementary materials.
# This script basically generates the underlying data used to produce 
# Figures 2-4 in the main text, plus data on all other cohorts (1950-1999) 
# which are not included in the figures, but whose values were estimated.

# The tables are exported as csv files in long format, which is easier to manipulate.
# The tables include estimates for all countries and regions, including 
# Australia and NZ, which are not included in the figures in the main text.
# The regional estimates include  median and IQR values, computed from the 
# individual-country estimates. Details of the estimation can be found in the main 
# text and in the Supporting Information.

# One table is generated for each different region and for country and regional-level
# estimates. Tables follow the following naming convention:
# [Figure to which the data corresponds in the main text]_[whether country or 
# regional estimates]_[type of measure]
